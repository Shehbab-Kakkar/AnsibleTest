ovs-networkpolicy- allow administrator to defines its own policies
each pod in the container has its own ip address
container in the pod behave as if they all are on the same host
To access pod services are used
services implemented round robin to access the pods. service also allow replicated pods to communicate to one another.
services use a selector attribute to connect to pods
each pods matching the selectors added to the service resource as an endpoint.
Pods as well as service ip address cannot be reached from outside the cluster.
OpenShift routes allow network access to pods from outside the openshift environment.
A dedicated router pod is used to load-balanc traffic between the target Pods
The router pods uses HAProxy and can be scaled itself
The router exposes a public facing ipaddress and dns hostname to the internal pod networking
Routers connect directory to the pods, the service is used for pod lookup only but not
involved in the actual traffic flow
